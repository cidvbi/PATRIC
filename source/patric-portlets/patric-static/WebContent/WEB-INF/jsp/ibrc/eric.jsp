		<p>You may have reached this page while looking for the Enteropathogen Resource Integration Center (ERIC) BRC at www.ericbrc.org.  The Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) for Infectious Diseases program is a continuation and expansion of a program initiated in 2004 and consists of four new centers, each specializing in a different group of pathogens.  The PATRIC BRC is now responsible for all bacterial species in the NIAID <a href="http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/list.htm" target="_blank">Category A-C Priority Pathogen lists for biodefense research, and pathogens causing emerging/reemerging infectious diseases</a>.
		</p>
		<p>For ERIC users, we understand that the resource was valuable to your work. As such, we will be doing our very best to create a useful PATRIC resource to continue supporting your work. We realize that the transition will cause disruptions.  However, it is a priority for us to work with established BRC users and communities to identify and prioritize our transition efforts. We will have a survey online soon to help us identify your needs, but in the meantime, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:patric@vbi.vt.edu">patric@vbi.vt.edu</a> with questions and requests.</p>
		<p>We have concentrated on the transfer of genomic data for this initial release.  We anticipate adding new data, tools, and website features over the next several months.  We look forward to working with you during the next 5 years.</p>

				<td><i>Escherichia</i>, a genus of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae. 
					<i>Escherichia coli</i> has become a model organism for studying many of life's essential processes partly due to 
						its rapid growth rate and simple nutritional requirements.
					Normally <i>E. coli</i> serves a useful function in the body by suppressing the growth of harmful bacterial species
					 and by synthesizing appreciable amounts of vitamins. 
					A minority of <i> E. coli </i> strains are capable of causing human illness by several different mechanisms.
					<i>E. coli</i> serotype O157:H7 is a rare variety of <i>E. coli</i> that produces large quantities of one or more related, potent
					toxins that cause severe damage to the lining of the intestine.

				<td><i>Photorhabdus</i> is a gram-negative member of the family Enterobacteriaceae that

					The nematode worm burrows into insect prey and regurgitates <i>Photorhabdus</i>,
				  	which goes on to kill the insect. Once the insect host is dead the bacteria
				  	bioconvert the tissues into more bacteria. The nematode feeds off the growing
				  	bacteria until the insect tissues are exhausted, whereupon they reassociate
				  	and leave the cadaver in search of new prey. This highly efficient
				  	partnership has been used for many years as a biological crop protection
				  	agent.  In addition to its well-described role as an insect pathogen one
				  	species of the genus, <i>P. asymbiotica</i>, causes infection in otherwise healthy humans.
